matlab-utils
============

A collection of useful (custom and file-exchange) scripts, toolboxes and such.
Licenses, readmes, and any other info for files obtained from other internet
sources are included. 


Custom Scripts
--------------

Functions and scripts written either in lab, or downloaded from the
file-exchange (may or may not be modified). 

 * `parseEEGFile` - reads EEG files generated my MJs machine
 * `taylorApprox` - carries out a taylor approx to some function
 * `arrow3` - draws arrow heads on lines 
 * `boundedline` - allows you to plot lines with shaded bounds, that can represent error or confidence bounds.
 * `createColorHistograms` - creates color histograms
 * `exportFig` - set of functions to export matlab figures to different types
 * `grep` - find anything!! 
 * `legendflex` - create a much more flexible legend!
 * `mtit` - easily adds a title to a group of subplots
 * `notifier` - emails you when your script/program finishes running
 * `panel` - allows for easier paneling of figures 
 * `pptfigure` - creates a group of objects in powerpoint for a figure in matlab!
   Awesome but cant get it to work in Powerpoint 2013 yet.
